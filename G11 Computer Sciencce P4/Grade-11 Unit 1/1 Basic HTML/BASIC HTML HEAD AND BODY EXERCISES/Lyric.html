        <br>Hold me close 'til I get up
        <br>Time is barely on our side
        <br>I don't wanna waste what's left
        <br>
        <br>The storms we chase are leading us
        <br>And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah
        <br>No, I don't wanna waste what's left
        <br>
        <br>And on and on we'll go
        <br>Through the wastelands, through the highways
        <br>'Til my shadow turns to sun rays
        <br>
        <br>And on and on we'll go
        <br>Through the wastelands, through the highways
        <br>And on and on we'll go
        <br>
        <br>Oh, on we'll go
        <br>
        <br>Finding life along the way
        <br>Melodies we haven't played
        <br>No, I don't want no rest
        <br>
        <br>Echoin' around these walls
        <br>Fighting to create a song (yeah)
        <br>I don't wanna miss a beat
        <br>
        <br>And on and on we'll go
        <br>Through the wastelands, through the highways
        <br>'Til my shadow turns to sun rays
        <br>
        <br>And on and on we'll go
        <br>Through the wastelands, through the highways
        <br>And on and on we'll go
        <br>
        <br>And we'll grow in number
        <br>Fueled by thunder, see the horizon
        <br>Turn us to thousands
        <br>
        <br>And we'll grow in number
        <br>Fueld by thunder, see the horizon
        <br>Turn us to thousands
        <br>
        <br>And on and on we'll go
        <br>Through the wastelands, through the highways
        <br>'Til my shadow turns to sun rays
        <br>
        <br>And on and on we'll go
        <br>Through the wastelands, through the highways
        <br>And on and on we'll go
        <br>
