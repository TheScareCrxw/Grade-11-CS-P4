            <li>Graphics</li> 
            <p>Valorant has 3 types of settings for graphics, High, Medium, and Low. 
                <br>
                The high setting makes all of the elements in the game have more reflection 
                <br>
                and shine to it whereas the meduim setting has less shine but more texture.
                <br>
                The low setting has the least amount of everything where there are no textures 
                <br>
                and shine/reflection.
            </p>
            <li>Gameplay</li> 
            <p>The way to play the game is there are 19 characters that are choosable in the
                <br>
                loading screen. You and 4 of your teammates choose 5 out of the 19 characters
                <br>
                and fight against 5 other people online. The game is out of 13 rounds in where 
                <br>
                each round you either try to kill everyone else or plant a bomb and let it blow up. 
                <br> 
                the game ends first to 13 and there is douce where if both teams are at 12 points,
                <br>
                2 rounds wins.
            </p>
            <li>Storyline</li>
            <p>The game is a 5v5 tactical shooter where over 19 million peoplep play monthly
                <br>
                There are many cheaters that have aim bot, wall hacks and many other types of 
                <br> 
                cheats. 
            </p>
            <li>Sound</li>
            <p>
                In Valorant sound is very important, it helps you locate where enemies are 
                <br>
                and can help with telling what is happening outside of your POV. Skins for 
                <br> 
                guns can also change the sound the gun being shot.
